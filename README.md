## Assignment
For the assignment we had to build a Pokémon Trainer web app using the Angular Framework.
To keep track of users and Pokémon we had to use an other [API](https://github.com/dewald-els/noroff-assignment-api) which Noroff made for easy use in our assignments.

It had to include a Start page, Translation page and a profile page.

## How To Use
Go to the following [website](https://pumpkin-tart-63407.herokuapp.com/login)

Enter a username and go catch Pokémon.

To use locally download or clone the repository and run `npm install` then run `ng serve` to start the program.

## Future
Future work may include:
- show more info btn to get more info like type and stats.
- colour coordinated frames for each pokemon according to type.
- pagination
- all pokemon generations
- other styling decisions
- media queries (mobile friendly)
- search bar
